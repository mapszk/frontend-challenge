# Front-end Challenge

This is my proposal for the front-end challenge, developed using Next 14, CSS Modules, and Resend to send emails with the contact form. You can have a look using the deployed version [here](https://frontend-challenge-tau-beige.vercel.app), which already has the contact form integrated with Resend. The form sends an email to the address entered in the field "Email".

### Environment variables

    RESEND_API_KEY=string

Note: the only variable necessary for this project is the Resend API Key (more info [here](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/api-keys/introduction)), this variable is necessary to integrate the contact form.

### Development

To run the project in a development environment use the following commands:

First install the dependencies

    npm install

Run the project

    npm run dev

Also, you can run the tests using the command

    npm run test

### Production

Deployed on Vercel: https://frontend-challenge-tau-beige.vercel.app
